API Broker is a middle man for API quests or web hooks, allowing you to modify the call on the fly.

The project was born out of an attempt to build a better sync for Gitkraken Glo Boards and Github Issues. The only problem was the API endpoint to trigger an update required some custom JSON to trigger, and you can't specify that in a webhook. As such, this project was born to allow you to inject that special code and make the magic happen.
